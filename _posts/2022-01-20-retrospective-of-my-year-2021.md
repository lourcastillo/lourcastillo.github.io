I'm a professional and mother of a child with an intellectual disability, with a diagnosis of autism and sensory disorder. I think a lot about my son's present and future and how to improve his life through what I am passionate about.

Through what I am passionate about and what I decided when I was young as a vocation in technology. My son will always be the first priority motivation that drives me forward. Although I feel that I am rowing against the current in a tremendously prejudiced world. I have decided to be my son's voice, and I firmly believe that technology is my best ally in this struggle. It would improve my future in many aspects on a personal and professional level, and my quality of life above all. When I was a child, at the age of 12, I realized what I wanted to be when I grew up. I also realized the decision I had made, and I don't regret any second of my life because I made the best decision ever to be a professional in technology. I am 34 years old. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and am currently working as a Quality Assurance Analyst.

I graduated with honors from the University of Americana in Ciudad del Este, Paraguay. I have worked hard to fulfill one of my dreams in life: to have a family. Due to life, I have not been able to advance with formal education as I dreamed. For example, I have not been able to do a diploma or postgraduate degree as I dreamed due to different life situations, especially the high cost of therapies for my son with autism. I have been able to obtain some certifications that have allowed me to have a job with good conditions. But, I desire to continue growing as a professional. Anyway, for better or worse, I will keep looking for opportunities and always value every opportunity. As a commitment to give back, I am part of non-profit organizations such as the Mozilla community, where we support the Mozilla manifesto in favor of the user and open web technologies to improve the quality of life of the user on the Internet both in Paraguay and Chile. Contributing to the organization of the Rotary Club Metropolitano District 4340 for community service and peace. The Rotary organization has empowered me with the value of high ethical standards and their importance in our day-to-day environment. Concerning these two organizations, I am always supported within a reasonable amount of time, usually dedicating a few hours on weekends. I especially like giving support online, which is the easiest way I have to support the activities that are generated. 

Best regards❤️
