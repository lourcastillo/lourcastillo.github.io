At this time I have canceled many activities in which I collaborate due to family-related issues. I have my son with autism with a very complex sensory disorder and for the past year, he has been increasing disruptive behaviors due to the context of the pandemic and the phases with their restrictions, which has been a setback for my son. I am focused on supporting my son moving forward. For that reason I prefer to postpone and/or decrease my volunteering with the community, it costs a lot. But I prefer to give a pause at least this year in collaboration issues to focus fully on my son ❤️ Lots of love!
