We need to support the Psychomotor Room Refurbishment Project from the [Anakena Elementary Special School](https://colegioanakena.cl/). This school has been serving students with special educational needs since 1987, as the years have passed the school has been developing a more inclusive and strengthened proposal to face the challenges we face as professionals.
 The fundamental pillars of the educational reform implemented in 2013 involve educational quality and inclusion. Our educational project aims to focus on these two objectives, on the one hand improving our pedagogical practices, and on the other ensuring that this educational process reaches all students, delivering meaning and motivation for their development. Our project aims to implement a systemic view, which recognizes all members of the school community as a fundamental part of the integral development of our students.
The school works inclusively to provide quality education to all of its students, who due to their disability conditions require additional adjustments and significant curricular adaptations.

The school is made up of a multidisciplinary and competent team, at the forefront of the education of students with autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disabilities, that, together with their families, seeks to promote their integral education and value their diversity.

**The school staff**

14 teachers
4 teachers who belong to the management team (2 Director of the Board of Directors, a General Director, Head of the Technical Pedagogical Unit)
4 Education Assistants (Occupational Therapist, Psychologist, Coexistence Manager, Speech therapist)
11 Technical assistants in special education
1 secretary
2 cleaning assistants

**Project Description**

Refurbishment and adaptation spaces for people with autism and intellectual disabilities to improve the quality of life of the students from Anakena special school.

**Importance of Project**

It will directly benefit 136 students of the Anakena Elementary School from La Comuna de La Florida, Santiago de Chile. The percentage of vulnerability (social registry of households), what we have access to report from families, is that the Anakena school currently serves 103 students in vulnerable situations. It’s important to mention that the Anakena school is free of charge.

**ASD Chile population**

A study was conducted to determine the prevalence of ASD in 2 urban districts of Santiago de Chile, the result was that in a sample of 272 boys and girls, 5 were clinically diagnosed with ASD. A prevalence of ASD of 1.95% was obtained with a sex distribution of 4 boys to 1 girl.
This is the first estimation of ASD prevalence in two cities of Santiago de Chile.
A high prevalence of this condition was obtained, which highlights the need to obtain resources for a multidisciplinary and early approach [Revista Chilena Pediatría 2021](https://www.revistachilenadepediatria.cl/index.php/rchped/article/view/2503).
